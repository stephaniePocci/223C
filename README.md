# Lab1-223C-
## This is a database of all my labs for my 223C class (C Programming).

## Assignment1.c
This is a program that simulates Tic-Tac-Toe for two players.

## Assignment2.c
This is a program that simulates an interactable resteraunt menu. It reads the menu items chosen by the user from a txt data file and displays it in-console. The text file provided by my professor got corrupted, but it will work with any given txt database file.

## Lab10.c
This lab taught me how to parse strings to search for certain phrases within strings. This specific program searches for the phrase "ould" within any given array. 

## Lab10P2.c
WIP

## Lab11.c
Lab 11 creates a text file with the given input. It will only take in input if it detects the word "and" in the same string. It will not input any strings that do not contain the word "and". Press enter without entering anything to exit the program and save the strings to the text file. 

## Lab14.c 
This lab calculates the area of a triangle.

## Lab15.c
This lab calcualtes the area of the rectangle and declares if the length or width is larger. 

## Lab16.c
This lab allows the user to choose to calculate the volume of a Rectangular Prism, a Pyramid, and an Ellipsoid. The user can enter any values entered by spaces to complete the calculation. 

## Lab17.c
WIP

## Lab19.c 
This lab calculates whether a point is within the boundaries of a rectangle, the perimeter, and the area.

## Lab1_StephaniePocci.c
This lab converts a list of given Celsius values to Fahrenheit.

## Lab2-Part1.c
This lab acts as an addition calculator for sales made in a given 3 days. It takes in user input for the amount of sales made per day.

## Lab2-Part2.c
This lab takes in user input of the user's address, combines each of the strings, and prints it.

## Lab2.c
This program simply takes in a string and prints it.

## Lab20.c
This program allows the user to input the number of nodes they would like to create, and input the number for each node. The program then traverses the list of nodes created.

## Lab21.c
This program allows the user to input the number of values that they would like to store in an array. The user can then enter each of the numbers and sum the entire array. You can then enter any value to search for it within the array, and it will return a confirmation if it is found. The program will end after it indicates that it was unable to find a specific number within the array. 

## Lab 22.c
This lab creates a struct of a student database. It takes in user input of the student's information, stores it, and then prints it.

## Lab3.c 
This program takes in user input for strings (press enter to separate the strings) and then prints a list indicating how many characters are in each given string.

## Lab4.c
This program takes in user input for how many numbers in the Fibonacci sequence they would like to print.

## Lab5.c
This program takes in 3 separate strings from the user. It then indicates which string was the largest.

## Lab6.c
WIP

## Lab8p1.c
WIP

## Lab8p2.c
If the user inputted number is divisble by 2, it will add 2 to the number and print it. If it is not, it will subtract the number by 1 and print it.
